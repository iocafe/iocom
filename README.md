# iocom
The IOCOM C library implements communication between a IoT/IO devices and control computer over TCP network (TLS optional) or full duplex serial communication.
12.2.2020 status: The basic communication functionality, network/cloud topology, security and IO device authentication are practically done, excluding details and what comes up in testing. Now we are testing on Windows, Linux, and ESP32/Arduino. There is still quite a bit to do on documentation, usage instructions, examples, micro-controller support and testing. The iocom depends on eosal library for platform/operating system abstraction. The library is not ready for end user, but available in case you want to participate in development while it is still easy to make changes.
