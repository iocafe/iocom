# iocom
The IOCOM C library implements communication between a IoT/IO devices and control computer over TCP network (TLS optional) or full duplex serial communication.
25.1.2020 status: The basic communication functionality, network/cloud topology, security and IO device authentication are practically done, excluding details and what comes up in testing. Code has been run on Windows, Linux, plain metal and STM32duino in varying configurations (not all of them complete). There is still quite a bit to do on documentation, usage instructions, examples, micro-controller support and testing. The iocom depends on eosal library for platform/operating system abstraction.
