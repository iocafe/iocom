# iocom
The IOCOM C library implements communication between a IoT/IO devices and control computer over TCP network (TLS optional) or full duplex serial communication.
2.9.2019 status: The code is at working prototype level and has been run on Windows 10/Visual Studio 2019, Linux/cmake, plain metal and STM32duino. Most basic features have been implemented, but documentation, usage instructions, examples and testing on multiple micro-controllers are still sketchy at the best. The iocom depends on eosal library for platform/operating system abstraction.
