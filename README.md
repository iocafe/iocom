# iocom
The IOCOM C library implements communication between a IoT/IO devices and control computer over TCP network (TLS optional) or full duplex serial communication.
9.9.2019 status: The code is at working prototype level and has been run on Windows, Linux, plain metal and STM32duino. Most basic features have been implemented, but documentation, usage instructions, examples and testing on multiple micro-controllers are still on the works. The iocom depends on eosal library for platform/operating system abstraction.
