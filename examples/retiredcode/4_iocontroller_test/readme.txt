notes 26.4.2021/pekka
4_iocontroller_test example controls an IO board trough TCP socket. This example assumes one memory block for inputs and the other for outputs,
and that the platform supports dynamic memory allocation and multithreading. Thus this example cannot be used in most microcontrollers.
