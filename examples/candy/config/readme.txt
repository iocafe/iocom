IO device pin, signal and parameter configuration information is set up as JSON source files. The JSON files, especially for IO pins, are

and to generate C code. 

signals - IOCOM signal configuration
pins - PIN IO configuration JSON
parameters - Device parameter list JSON
network - Network default configuration
include - Generated C code and headers.
intermediate - Intermediate files generated by scripts.
