# -D SERIAL_TX_BUFFER_SIZE=? and -D SERIAL_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=? set serial
# buffer sizes. The IOCOM RX buffer should be 256 bytes. In practise
# smaller RX buffer, like 128, usually works (data amounts are small).
# Optimal value for TX buffer is 256 bytes, but this is set to 64
# bytes. The worst what could happen is small delay in loop. Anyhow this is not
# expected, since Uno memory blocks are typically small.
