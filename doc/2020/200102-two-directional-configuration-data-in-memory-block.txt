two dictional memory blocks
2.1.2020

- supporting bidirectional transfers on low level IO devices takes considerable amount of resources and may often be unnecessary
- use only for testers, configuration tools, etc. Do not use for normal IO communication, reliable recovery from exception situations gets compilcated. Stick with one directional memory blocks, and you will be happier. 

Both source and target buffers exist memory block in higher and in lower level.

Source buffer tracks invalidated addressess at byte precision. This is done 
Only invalidated data is transferred, again at byte precision.

Received changes coming from lower hierarchy level are not eached back down to same memory block. 

NAGLES ALGORITHM MUST BE ENABLED WITH BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFERS, otherwise TCP packet fragmentation may occur.
