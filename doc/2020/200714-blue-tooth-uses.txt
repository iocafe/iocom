Blue tooth

Blue tooth could be used alternatively for:
- Connecting user interface, like ispy (can be a security harard).
- As debug console port to print trace and error output for troubleshooring and set up wifi from command line (handy for debugging real devices).
- As an alternative to gazerbeam for setting wifi network, password, device number, etc (could be useful for end used).
- Connecting ear phones, etc. in case someone makes voice applications?

I do not see use for blue tooth in normal communication, since Wifi/Ethernet do all and more what blue tooth does (and better).
