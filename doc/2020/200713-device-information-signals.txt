Device information signals

device name, number, network name, connect to (currently used)
Software version + installed package
operating system
architecture
hardware

Error states, etc from netinfo

Network overrides
Network setup
Currently selected by DHCP

Resource counters + main loop speed ns.


1. Could this be dynamically created JSON, like loading from peristent block? - NO needs to have multiple simultaneous users.
2. Could this be flat memory information as JSON, like info - yes
3. Could this be simply signals - yes

Modifying - setting network overdrives would be nice. Plus for option 3.
Needed memory - Plus for option 2.
Dynamic - content can be added and removed, plus for option 2.


Maybe signals anyhow.
- Defaults JSON in iocom/config
- Can be modified to be app specific
- Code needs to detect which signals are there at compile time
- Implement as separate library, iocom extension. Header only library, needs to adopt to defines for application and sbuild ?

This relates to blue tooth setup? maybe?
Should we be able to use blootooth for full UI connections - Yes in case of complex/configurable IO devices

These can be in basic exp and imp stuff?



Grouping of data


Current configuration and state
- device name
- device nr
- IO network name
- Wifi network(s) and password(s)
- DHCP/static + currently used network settings
- Error code

Set overdrives + reboot + factory reset (security)
- device nr
- IO network name
- Wifi network(s) and password(s)
- DHCP/static + network parameters
- Reboot
- Factory reset

Software and hardware info
- Installation package
- eosal version
- iocom version
- Operating system
- Architecture
- HW?

Resource counters and main loop speed
- Socket opens
- Memory
- Loop, average
- Loop, max
- Time since last boot.
- Reset counters?
