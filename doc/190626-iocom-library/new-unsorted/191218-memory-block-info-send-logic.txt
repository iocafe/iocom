Logic for sending memory block info messages

*** new connection:
- If new connection is pointing "upward", add all memory blocks to connection's global transfer list.

*** new memory block by app function call (not trough new received memory block info):
- Add memory block to global transfer list of all connections pointing upwards.

*** memory block info received from connection pointing downwards.
- Create memory block if we do not have one. Resize if needed.
- Set up transfer buffer (for send or receive) if we do not have one.
- Add memory block to global transfer list of all connections pointing upwards.
- Add memory block to connection's downwards transfer list.

*** memory block info received from connection pointing updards.
- Memory block should exist. If not ignore the info message.
- Store id?

*** Maintaining transfer list:
- global list for sending memory block info upwards: a connection has current memory block
  pointer (con->sinfo.current_mblk), chain of all memory blocks (mblk->link.next) is used
  to move to next item in list.

- connections downwnwards transfer list is kept trough transfer buffers, so two heads (separate ones 
  for source and target buffers). Heads are con->info_down_head_s con->info_down_head_t.
  links are sbuf->info_down_next and tbuf->info_down_next.
