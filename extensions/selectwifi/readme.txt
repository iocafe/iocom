The selectwifi library is small library to allow setting wifi network name (SSID) and password (pre shared key) over blue tooth or serial port.
This library is liked to IO board code, and can be used when connecting WiFi IO board without display/keyboard to network.
Functionality is purposedly limited to only setting WiFi connection. Since the blue tooth and serial port connections are unsecure, there 
is no support for software updates or security configuration.
